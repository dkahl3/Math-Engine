# Math-Engine 

This code implements Vectors, Matrices, and Quaternions in C++ by using classes and operator overloading.  
The purpose of this is to create easy to use types and methods for calculating 3D math. 

## Vectors
- Direct access to x, y, z components for easy computation
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Scalar Multiplication
- Scalar Division
- Dot Product
- Cross Product
- Magnitude
- Normalize
- Rotation (Using Quaternions)

## Matrices (3x3)
- Direct access list of data for easy computation
- Data formated in column major for ease of use with OpenGL
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication
- Identity Matrix
- Inverse Matrix
- Transpose Matrix
- Vector Transformation

## Quaternions
- Easy access to scalar and vector components for computation
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Scalar Multiplication
- Quaternion Multiplication
- Norm
- Normalize
- Conjugate
- Inverse
